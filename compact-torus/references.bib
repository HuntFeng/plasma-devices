  abstract = {The spherical torus (ST) and compact torus (CT) are two kinds of alternative magnetic confinement fusion concepts with compact geometry. The ST is actually a sub-category of tokamak with a low aspect ratio; while the CT is a toroidal magnetic configuration with a simply-connected geometry including spheromak and field reversed pinch. The ST and CT have potential advantages for ultimate fusion reactor; while at present they can also provide unique fusion science and technology contributions for mainstream fusion research. However, some critical scientific and technology issues should be extensively investigated.}

  abstract  = {Compact torus injection into the Saskatchewan Torus-Modified [Phys. Fluids B 4, 3277 (1992)] tokamak discharges has triggered improved confinement characterized by an increase in the electron density by more than twofold, 30% reduction in the Hα radiation level, significant suppression of floating potential fluctuations and m=2 Mirnov oscillations. In this paper, we present detailed experimental setup and results, as well as an extended theory explaining the mechanism for triggering improved confinement in a tokamak by compact torus injection.},

  abstract  = {A possible means for reducing core complexity and size could lie with research into simply connected compact tori. Much progress has been made in the last 20 years, and now tokamak-like confinement is being reported, with work focusing on understanding beta-limits, transport and novel means of generating magnetic fields both in sustained and pulsed scenarios. Compact torus research is maturing, with many experiments integrated into a national program to resolve well defined critical physics issues. This article summarizes the work from the last 20 years both as a historical overview and an outline of the present status.},
