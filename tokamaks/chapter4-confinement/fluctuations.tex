\section{Fluctuations}
\begin{frame} {Fluctuations}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Turbulent fluctuations produce an $\mathbf{E\times B}$ drift velocity $\delta v_\perp = \delta E_\perp/B$.
        \item With density fluctuation $\delta n$, the convective particle flux is
              \[ \Gamma = \expval{\delta v_\perp\delta n} \]
              Average is taken over the flux surface.
        \item With magnetic fluctuations $\delta \mathbf{B}$, the flux is
              \[ \Gamma_j = \frac{n}{B}\expval{\delta v_{\parallel j}\delta B_r} \]
    \end{itemize}

Figure (a) is for ion cyclotron heating and Fig.(b) is for neutral beam beating. Both figures also give results for ohmic heating.}

\begin{frame} {Turbulence-Induced Transport}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Transport due to electrostatic fluctuations}:
              \[ D = \sum_k \left( \frac{k_\perp\delta\phi_k}{B} \right)^2 \tau_k \]
              We have assumed the fluctuations of electric potential $\delta\phi = \sum_k\delta\phi_ke^{i\mathbf{k\cdot x}}$. The time variation of the fluctuation is characterized by $\tau_k \sim 1/\omega_k$.
        \item \textbf{Transport due to magnetic fluctuations}:
              \[ D_M = \sum_k \frac{k_\perp\omega_k^3}{L_s} \]
    \end{itemize}
